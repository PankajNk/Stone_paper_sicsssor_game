# Stone_paper_sicsssor_game

Hope you all played this game in childhood :)  :) ,Now lets play with computer 

Program is console based  and used random library with loop condition

## Description of Game
   The players may count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Stone! Paper! Scissors!"), either raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down with each syllable     or holding it behind their back. They then "throw" by extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players throw immediately on the third count        (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!"), or a version where they shake their hands three times before "throwing".
